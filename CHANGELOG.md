            burdened Grid member by default, thus allowing for easy load-balancing.
- Multi-Instance scans
    - Instances now communicate via UNIX domain sockets when all of them are on
        the same host, to avoid TCP/IP overhead for IPC.
    - `RPC::Server::Instance#scan`
        - Added `grid_mode` option:
            - `:balance` -- Slaves will be provided by the least burdened
                Grid Dispatchers.
            - `:aggregate` -- In addition to balancing, slaves will all be from
                Dispatchers with unique bandwidth Pipe-IDs to result in
                application-level line-aggregation.
    - `RPC::Server::Framework`
        - No longer performs a multi-Instance scan when its Dispatcher is a Grid
            member. The `grid` or `grid_mode` options need to be set explicitly,
            along with a `spawns` option value of 1 and higher.
        - General code cleanup.
            - Multi-Instance code moved under the `RPC::Server::Framework::MultiInstance`
                module which concentrates multi-Instance code and pulls in the
                following modules:
                - `RPC::Server::Framework::Slave` -- Holds API and utilities for
                    slave instances.
                - `RPC::Server::Framework::Master` -- Holds API and utilities for
                    master instances.
        - Master seed crawl runs in its own thread to avoid blocking during the
            initial seeding process.
        - Removed the concept of issue summaries -- were used for lightweight
            transmission of issue data for real-time feedback. Instead, full issues
            are being buffered and flushed to the master after each page is audited.
    - `RPC::Server::Framework::Distributor#distribute_elements`
        - Optimized to handle large data sets.
    - `RPC::Server::Spider`
        - Updated buffering strategy to reduce RPC calls.

- Moved supporting classes under `Arachni::Support`.
    - `Support::Cache` classes now store `#hash` values of keys to preserve space.
    - Added:
        - `Support::LookUp` namespace to hold look-up optimized data structures with:
            - `Support::LookUp::HashSet` -- Stores hashed items in a `Set`.
            - `Support::LookUp::Moolb` -- Reverse of a Bloom-filter.
        - `Support::Queue::Disk` -- Disk Queue with in-memory buffer.
- Added:
    - `Arachni::Platform` -- Holds resources relevant to platform identification,
        storage, and filtering.
        - `Fingerprinters` -- Namespace under which all fingerprinter
            components reside.
        - `List` - List structure holding applicable platforms for a given WWW resource.
        - `Manager` - Collection of `Lists`s for easy management of platforms of
            different types.
    - `IO#tail` -- Returns a specified amount of lines from the bottom of a file.
    - Process helpers for RPC Instance and Dispatcher servers.
        - `Arachni::Processes::Dispatchers` -- Spawns and kills Dispatchers.
        - `Arachni::Processes::Instances` -- Spawns and kills Instances.
        - `Arachni::Processes::Manager` -- Forks and kills processes.
- RSpec tests
    - Major cleanup, using the aforementioned process helpers to remove duplicate code.
    - Moved supporting components under `spec/support/`.

  - Added ```--exclude-page``` to exclude pages whose bodies match the given patterns.
  - Added ```--version``` to show version info.
- Updated exceptions thrown by the framework, removed ```Arachni::Exceptions```
    namespace and replaced it with the ```Arachni::Error``` base exception from
    which all component specific exceptions inherit.
- RPC
  - Handlers
      - ```opts``` -- Now presents the ```RPC::Server::ActiveOptions```
           interface which actively configures certain options across multiple system
           components.
      - ```service``` -- Updated with the following convenience methods in order
            to provide a simpler interface for users who don't wish to bother with
            the more specialised handlers (```opts```,```modules```, ```framework```, etc.):
          - ```#errors``` -- Returns the contents of the error log.
          - ```#scan``` -- Configures and runs the scan.
          - ```#progress``` -- Aggregates progress information.
          - ```#busy?``` -- Checks whether the scan is still in progress.
          - ```#pause``` -- Pauses the scan (delegated to ```RPC::Server::Framework#pause```).
          - ```#resume``` -- Resumes the scan (delegated to ```RPC::Server::Framework#resume```).
          - ```#abort_and_report``` -- Cleans up the framework and returns the report.
          - ```#abort_and_report_as``` -- Cleans up the framework and returns the
            result of the specified report component.
          - ```#status``` -- Returns the status of the Instance.
          - ```#report``` -- Returns the scan report as a ```Hash```.
          - ```#report_as``` --  Returns the scan report in one of the available formats (as a ```String```).
          - ```#shutdown``` -- Shuts down the Instance/stops the scan.
      - ```framework``` -- Clients no longer need to call ```framework.clean_up``` unless cancelling a running scan.
  - Protocol -- Now supports both ```Marshal``` and ```YAML``` automatically.
      - ```Marshal``` by default since it's many times faster than ```YAML```.
      - ```YAML``` as an automatic fallback in order to maintain backwards compatibility and ease of integration with 3rd parties.
          - Updated to use the Ruby-default ```Psych``` engine.
  - ```Framework```
      - Updated gathering of slave status -- once a slave is done it reports back to the master.
      - Clean-up happens automatically, clients no longer need to call ```#clean_up``` (like previously mentioned).
      - Slave instances now buffer their logged issues and report them to the Master in batches.
      - ```#issues``` now returns the first variation of each issue to provide more info/context.
  - ```Dispatcher```
      - Added ```#workload_score``` returning the workload score of a Dispatcher as a ```Float```.
      - Workload score calculation no longer uses CPU/RAM resource usage (since
        that data is not available on all platforms) but instead the amount of running
        instances and node weight.
- Trainer -- Added a hard-limit for trainings per page to avoid time-consuming loops.
- Spider
  - Updated to retry a few times when the server fails to respond.
      - Failed requests returned by ```#failures```.

      - ```#push_to_url_queue```
- HTTP
  - Fixed corruption of binary response bodies due to aggressive sanitization.
  - Custom-404 page detection updated to:

    - Updated to include Issue remarks.
- Issues
    - Added attribute ```remarks``` holding a ```Hash``` of remarks about
        that issue with the entity which made the remark as _key_ and an ```Array```
        of remarks as _value_.

- Removed
      - Web User Interface -- The new interface is a
        [project of its own](https://github.com/Arachni/arachni-ui-web) and not

        - Updated to use the framework HTTP interface instead of Net::HTTP
        - Now injects a handy little control panel into each responce which allows recording of
            login sequences and inspection of discovered pages/elements.
    - VectorFeed -- Reads in vector data from which it creates elements to be audited.
      Can be used to perform extremely specialized/narrow audits on a per vector/element basis.
