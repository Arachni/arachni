- Major refactoring
    - ```Arachni::Parser::Element::Auditable``` and ```Arachni::Module::Auditor```.
        - Moved analysis techniques from Auditor to Auditable to enable per element audits and analysis
          in order to increase audit granularity and ease scripting.
        - Auditor methods now simply iterate over candidate elements and delegate analysis to them.
    - Updated URL normalization methods and added caching to resource intensive parsing operations,
      leading to overall improvements, especially during the initial crawling process. (**New**)
    - Moved from Ruby's URI lib to ```Addressable::URI```. (**New**)
    - Project-wide code clean-up, documentation and style improvements.
- Options
    - ```--cookie-string``` -- Allows the specification of cookies as a string in the form of: ```name=value; name2=value2``` (**New**)
    - ```--exclude-vectors``` -- Excludes vectors (parameters), by name, from the audit. (**New**)
- Modules - Every single one has been cleaned up and have had RSpec tests added.
    - API
        - Updated to provide access to running plugins.
        - Updated remote file detection and logging helpers to improve performance and accuracy in case of custom 404s.
        - Audit operations by default follow redirects.
        - Issue de-duplication has been updated to be a lot more aggressive for
            issues discovered by manipulating inputs, variations have been restricted to just 1.
    - Unencrypted password forms -- Checks for non-nil form fields before iterating. [Issue #136]
    - SSN -- Improved regexp and logging. [Issue #170]

    - HttpOnly cookies -- Logs cookies without the 'HttpOnly' flag. (**New**)
- Plugins
    - Proxy -- Fixed typo in code which prevented headers from being properly.
      forwarded which results in non-existent content-types which prevented proper parsing. [Issue #135]
    - VectorFeed -- Reads in vector data from which it creates elements to be audited.
      Can be used to perform extremely specialized/narrow audits on a per vector/element basis.
      Useful for unit-testing or a gazillion other things. (**New**)
    - Script -- Loads and runs an external Ruby script under the scope of a plugin, used for debugging and general hackery. (**New**)
- Extras
    - All modules under <tt>/extras</tt> had to be removed because they distributed GPLv3 licensed content.

    - Removed tagging of requests with the system-wide seed.
- Spider -- Re-written, much cleaner design and code. (**New**)
