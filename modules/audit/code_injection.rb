                description:     %q{A modern web application will be reliant on 
                    several different programming languages. These languages can 
                    be broken up into two flavours. These are client side 
                    languages such as those that run in the browser eg. 
                    JavaScript and HTML, and server side languages that are 
                    executed by the server (ASP, PHP, JSP, etc) to form the 
                    dynamic pages (client side code) that are then sent to the 
                    client. Because all server side code should be executed by 
                    the server, it should only ever come from a trusted source. 
                    Code injection occurs when the server takes untrusted server 
                    side code (ie. From the client) and executes the code as if 
                    it were on the server. Cyber-criminals will abuse this 
                    weakness to execute their own arbitrary code on the server, 
                    and could result in complete compromise of the server. 
                    Arachni was able to inject specific server side code and 
                    have the executed output from the code contained within the 
                    server response. This indicates that proper input 
                    sanitisation is not occurring.},

                severity:        Severity::HIGH,
                cvssv2:          '7.5',
                remedy_guidance: %q{ It is recommended that untrusted or 
                    invalidated data is never stored where it may then be 
                    executed as server side code. To validate data, the 
                    application should ensure that the supplied value contains 
                    only the characters that are required to perform the 
                    required action. For example, where a username is required, 
                    then no non-alpha characters should be accepted. 
                    Additionally, within PHP, the "eval" and "preg_replace" 
                    functions should be avoided as these functions can easily be 
                    used to execute untrusted data. If these functions are used 
                    within the application then these parts should be rewritten. 
                    The exact way to rewrite the code depends on what the code 
                    in question does, so there is no general pattern for doing 
                    so. Once the code has been rewritten the eval() function 
                    should be disabled. This can be achieved by adding eval to 
                    disable_funcions within the php.ini file.},
