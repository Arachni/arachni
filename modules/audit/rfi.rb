                description: %q{: Web applications occasionally use a parameters 
                    values to store the value of a file required by the server. 
                    An example of this is often seen in error pages where the 
                    actual file path for the error page is called the parameter 
                    value. For example 'yoursite.com/error.php?page=404.php'. A 
                    remote file inclusion occurs when the parameter value (ie. 
                    path to file being called by the server) can be substituted 
                    with the address of an external host, and the server then 
                    performs a request to the external host and fetches the 
                    resource. Taking the simple example above this would become 
                    'yoursite.com/error.asp?page=http://anothersite.com/somethingBad.php'. 
                    In most circumstances the server will process the fetched 
                    resource. Therefor if the resource matches that of the 
                    framework being used (ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) it is probable 
                    that the resource will be executed on the vulnerable server. 
                    Cyber-criminals will abuse this vulnerability to execute 
                    arbitrary code on the server. Arachni discovered that it was 
                    possible to substitute a parameter value with an external 
                    resource and have the server fetch the resource and have it 
                    returned to the client within the response. },

                    invalidated data is never used to form a literal file 
                    include request. To validate data, the application should 
                    ensure that the supplied value for a file is permitted. This 
                    can be achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter 
                    value. The whitelist should contain a list of pages (or 
                    sites) that the application is permitted to fetch resources 
                    from. If the supplied value does not match any value in the 
                    whitelist then the server should redirect to a standard 
                    error page. In some scenarios where dynamic content is being 
                    requested it may not be possible to perform validation of a 
                    list of trusted resources, therefor the list must also 
                    become dynamic (update as the files change), or perform 
                    filtering to remove any unrequired user input such as 
                    semicolons or periods etc. and only permit a-z0-9.},
