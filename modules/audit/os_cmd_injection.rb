                    web application, it is occasionally required to fun 
                    operating commands (Linux or Windows) and have the output of 
                    these commands captured by the web application and returned 
                    o the client. OS command injection occurs when user supplied 
                    input is inserted into one of these commands without proper 
                    sanitisation and executed by the server. Cyber criminals 
                    will abuse this weakness to perform their own arbitrary 
                    commands on the server. This can include everything from 
                    simple ping commands to map the internal network, to 
                    obtaining full control of the server. Arachni was able to 
                    inject specific operating commands and have the output from 
                    that command contained within the server response. This 
                    indicates that proper input sanitisation is not occurring.},
