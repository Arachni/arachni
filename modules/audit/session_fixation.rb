# Session fixation module.
#
# It identifies the session cookie by iterating through all cookies in the
# cookie-jar and performing login checks with each cookie removed.
# The session cookie is the one which results in a failed check.
#
# It then injects a taint via all page links and forms and checks whether or
# not the taint ended-up in the session cookie's value.
# If so, the webapp is vulnerable.
#
# The module requires a login-check and a valid, logged-in session.

                description: %q{HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefor 
                    the server is unable to determine which requests are 
                    performed by which client, and which clients are 
                    authenticated or unauthenticated. The use of HTTP cookies 
                    within the headers, allows a web server to identify each 
                    individual client, and can therefor determine which clients 
                    hold valid authentication from those that do not. These are 
                    known as session cookies or session tokens. To prevent 
                    clients from being able to guess each other's session token, 
                    each assigned session token should be entirely random, and 
                    be different whenever a session is established with the 
                    server. Session fixation occurs when the client is able to 
                    specify their own session token value, and the value of the 
                    session cookie is not changed by the server after successful 
                    authentication. Occasionally the session token will also 
                    remain unchanged for the user independent of how many times 
                    they have authenticated. Cyber-criminals will abuse this 
                    functionality by sending crafted URL links with a 
                    predetermined session token within the link. The cyber-
                    criminal will then wait for the victim to login and become 
                    authenticated. If successful the cyber-criminal will know a 
                    valid session ID, and therfor have access to the victim's 
                    session. Arachni has discovered that it is able to set its 
                    own session token, and during the login process remains 
                    unchanged. Some further attack scenarios are here:

                    prevent the server accepting client supplied tokens through 
                    either a GET or POST request. Additionally, the clients 
                    session token should be changed at specific key stages of 
                    the application flow, such as during authentication. This 
                    will ensure that even if clients are able to set their own 
                    cookie, it will not persist into an authenticated session.
