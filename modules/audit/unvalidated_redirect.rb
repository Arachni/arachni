                    parameters values to store the address of the page that will 
                    the client will be redirected to. As an example, this is 
                    often seen in error pages where the error page is the page 
                    to be displayed. For example 
                    'yoursite.com/page.asp?redirect=www.yoursite.com/404.asp'. 
                    An invalidated redirect occurs when the client is able to 
                    modify the affected parameter value in the request and have 
                    a redirect response to the new value sent by the server. 
                    Therefor redirecting the client to that site. For example 
                    the performing the following request 
                    'yoursite.com/page.asp?redirect=www.anothersite.com' will 
                    redirect to anothersite.com. Cyber-criminals will abuse 
                    these vulnerabilities in social engineering attacks to get 
                    users to unknowingly visit a malicious site hosted by the 
                    cyber-criminal. Arachni has discovered that the server does 
                    not validate the parameter value prior to redirecting the 
                    client to the injected value.},

                    supplied value for a redirect is permitted. This can be 
                    achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter value. 
                    The whitelist should contain a list of pages or sites that 
                    the application is permitted to redirect users to. If the 
                    supplied value does not match any value in the whitelist
