                description:     %q{Web applications occasionally use a 
                    parameters values to store the value of a file required by 
                    the server. An example of this is often seen in error pages 
                    where the actual file path for the error page is called the 
                    parameter value. For example 
                    'yoursite.com/error.php?page=404.php'. A path traversal 
                    occurs when the parameter value (ie. path to file being 
                    called by the server) can be substituted with the relative 
                    path of another resource which is located outside of the 
                    applications working directory (web root). The server then 
                    loads the resource and sends it in the response to the 
                    client. Cyber-criminals will abuse this vulnerability to 
                    view files that should otherwise not be accessible. A very 
                    common example of this on a *nix server is where the cyber-
                    riminal will access the /etc/passwd file to retrieve a list 
                    of users on the server. This attack would look similar to 
                    'yoursite.com/error.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd'. As 
                    path traversal is based on the relative path, the payload 
                    must first traverse the file system to the root directory, 
                    and hence the string of '../../../../'. Arachni discovered 
                    that it was possible to substitute a parameter value with 
                    relative path to a common operating system file and have the 
                    contents of the file sent back in the response.},

                remedy_guidance: %q{It is recommended that untrusted or 
                    invalidated data is never used to form a literal file 
                    include request. To validate data, the application should 
                ensure that the supplied value for a file is permitted. This can 
                    be achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter 
                    value. The whitelist should contain a list of pages that 
                    the application is permitted to fetch resources from. If the 
                    supplied value does not match any value in the whitelist 
                    then the server should redirect to a standard error page. In 
                    some scenarios where dynamic content is being requested it 
                    may not be possible to perform validation of a list of 
                    trusted resources, therefor the list must also become 
                    dynamic (update as the files change), or perform filtering 
                    to remove any unrequired user input such as semicolons or 
                    periods etc. and only permit a-z0-9. It is also advised that 
                    sensitive file are not stored within the web root, and that 
                    the user permissions enforced by the directory are correct.},
