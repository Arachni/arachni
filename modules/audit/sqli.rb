                description:     %q{Databases are used to store data. Due to the 
                    requirement for dynamic content of today's web applications, 
                    many web applications rely on a database backend to store 
                    data that will be called upon and processed by the web 
                    application (or other programs). Web applications retrieve 
                    data from the database by using a Structured Query Language 
                    (SQL) query. To meet demands of many developers, database 
                    servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle etc.) have 
                    additionally built in functionality that can allow extensive 
                    control of the database and interaction with the host 
                    operating system itself. An SQL injection occurs when a 
                    value originating from the clients request is used within an 
                    SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow the 
                    cyber-criminal to steal the data stored in the database, or 
                    use the additional functionality of the database server to 
                    take complete control of the server. When discovered, this 
                    allows cyber-criminals the ability to inject their own SQL 
                    query (injected query will normally be placed within the 
                    existing application query) and have it executed by the 
                    database server. The successful exploitation of a SQL 
                    injection can be a devastating to an organisation, and is 
                    one of the most commonly exploited web application 
                    vulnerabilities. To discover a SQL injection, Arachni 
                    injects multiple different payloads into specific locations 
                    within the client request. Arachni discovered that the 
                    affected page and parameter may be vulnerable. This 
                    injection was detected as Arachni was able to cause the 
                    server to respond to the request with a database related 
                    error. This is the easiest form of detection, and is known 
                    as error based SQL injection vulnerability.},

                remedy_guidance: %q{The only proven method to prevent against 
                    SQL injection attacks while still maintaining full 
                    application functionality is to use parametized queries 
                    (also known as prepared statements). When utilising this 
                    ethod of querying the database any value supplied by the 
                    client will be handled as a string value rather than part of 
                    the SQL query. Additionally, when utilising parametized 
                    queries, the database engine will automatically check to 
                    make sure the sting being used matches that of the column. 
                    For example the database engine will check the user supplied 
                    input is an integer if the database column is also an 
                    integer. Depending on the framework being used, 
                    implementation of parametized queries will differ. For 
                    framework specific examples see: 'www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp'. 
                    Other methods to help protect against SQL injection 
                    vulnerabilities exist however are not as effective and may 
                    either limit web application functionality, or remain 
                    vulnerable. For further information on these methods see: 
                    'www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet'. 
                    Additional remediation activities such as configuring strict 
                    database permissions to limit queries that can be executed, 
                    and configuring the webserver to display custom error 
                    messages to prevent error based detection will both further 
                    reduce the risk.},
