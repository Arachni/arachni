                description: %q{To prevent the automated abuse of a page, 
                    applications can implement what is known as a CAPTCHA. These 
                    are used to ensure human interaction with the application, 
                    and are often used on forms where the application conducts 
                    sensitive actions. These typically include user registration
                    , or submitting emails via the contact us page etc. Arachni 
                    has flagged this not as a vulnerability, but as a prompt for 
                    the penetration tester to conduct further manual testing on 
                    the CAPTCHA function, As Arachni cannon audit CAPTCHA 
                    protected forms. Testing for insecurely implemented CAPTCHA 
                    is a manual process, and an insecurely implemented CAPTCHA 
                    could allow a cyber-criminal a means to abuse these 
                    sensitive actions. },

                    based off of this finding alone, manual testing should 
                    ensure that: 1. The server keeps track of CAPTCHA tokens in 
                    use, and has the token terminated by the server after first 
                    use or after a period of time. Therefor preventing replay

                    within the response that is sent to the client. 3. The 
                    CAPTCHA image should not be weak and easily solved. For
