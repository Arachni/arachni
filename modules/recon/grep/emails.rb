                    'contact us' pages, however can also be found within scripts 
                    or code comments of the application. They are used to 
                    provide a legitimate means of contacting an organisation. As 
                    one of the initial steps in information gathering, cyber-
                    criminals will spider a website and using automated methods 
                    collect as many email addresses as possible, that they may 
                    then use in a social engineering attack against that user. 
                    Using the same automated methods, Arachni was able to detect 
                    one or more email addresses that were stored within the 
                    affected page.},

                remedy_guidance: %q{As a general rule, email addresses should be 
                    presented in such a way that it is hard for scripts to 
                    process them automatically. For example, 
                    'test@arachni-scanner.com' may become 
                    'test[at]yourdomain[dot]com'. Although this will force extra 
                    user interaction when utilising the address (changing [dot] 
                    to . etc) it will reduce the likelihood that these emails 
                    will be discovered by an automated process. To provide 
                    further protection against manual discovery, generic email 
                    addresses should be used. For example on a 'contact us' page 
                    'contactus@arachni-scanner.com' should be utilised instead 
                    of an individual's email address such as 
                    'john.doe@arachni-scanner.com'. Performing this extra step 
                    may reduce the likelihood of username enumeration for the 
                    domain.}
