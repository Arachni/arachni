                    there is a high possibility that the cyber-criminal has 
                    implemented a backdoor so that they can easily return to the 
                    server if required. One method of achieving this is to place 
                    a web backdoor or web shell within the web root of the web 
                    server. This will then enable the cyber-criminal to access 
                    the server through a HTTP/S session. Although extremely bad 
                    practice, it is possible that the web backdoor or web shell 
                    has been placed there by an administrator so they can 
                    perform administration activities remotely. During the 
                    initial recon stages of an attack cyber-criminals will 
                    attempt to locate these web backdoors or web shell by 
                    requesting the names of the most common and well known 
                    backdoors. By analysing the response headers from the server 
                    they are able to determine if a web backdoor or web shell 
                    exists. These web backdoors or web shells can then provide 
                    an easy path for further compromise of the server. By 
                    utilising the same methods as the cyber-criminals, Arachni 
                    was able to discover a possible web backdoor or web shell.},

                    backdoor or web shell does exist on the server then it

                    response investigation be conducted on the server to 
                    establish how the web backdoor or web shell came to end up
