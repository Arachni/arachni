                    be used on a webserver, for example OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, 
                    POST, PUT, DELETE etc.  Each of these methods perform a 
                    different function, and each have an associate level of risk 
                when their use is permitted on the webserver. A client can use 
                    the OPTION method within a request to query a server to 
                    determine which methods are allowed. Cyber-criminals will 
                    almost always perform this simple test as it will give a 
                    very quick indication of any risk methods being permitted by 
                    the server. Arachni discovered that several methods

                    approach be taken to permit HTTP methods required by the

                    Typically the only HTTP methods required for most 
                    applications are the GET, and POST methods. All other 
                    methods perform actions that are rarely required, or perform 
                    actions that are inherently risky. These risky methods (such 
                    as PUT, DELETE, etc) should be protected by strict 
                    limitations such as ensuring that the channel is secure 
                    (SSL/TLS enabled), and only authorised and trusted clients 
                    are permitted to use them.}
