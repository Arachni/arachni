                    webserver, developers can implement various methods of 
                    authentication. Therefor only allowing access to clients 
                    utilising valid credentials. There are several forms of 
                    authentication that can be used. The simplest forms of 
                    authentication are known as 'Basic' and 'Basic Realm'. 
                    These methods of authentication have several known 
                    weaknesses such as being susceptible to brute force attacks. 
                    Additionally when utilised with NTLM in a windows 
                    environment, several disclosures of information exist, and 
                    any brute force attack occurs against the server's local 
                    users or any domain users if the web server is a domain 
                    member. Cyber-criminals will attempt to locate protected 
                    pages to both attempt to gain access to them, or attempt 
                    brute force attacks to discover valid credentials. Arachni

                    required for the functionality of the web application they 
                    should be removed, otherwise it is recommended that basic 
                    and basic realm authentication are not used to protect 
                    against pages requiring authentication. If NTLM based basic 
                    authentication must be used, then default server and domain 
                    accounts such as administrator and root should be disabled, 
                    as these will undoubtedly be the first accounts to be 
                    targeted in any such attack. Additionally the webserver 
                    should not be joined to any corporate domain where usernames 
                    are readily available (such as from email addresses). If the 
                    pages are required, and it is possible to remove the basic 
                    authentication, then the stronger and more resilient form 
                    based authentication should be implemented to protect the 
                    affected pages.}
