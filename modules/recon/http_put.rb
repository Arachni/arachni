                description:     %q{There are various methods in which a file or 
                    files may be uploaded to a webserver. One method that can be 
                    used is the HTTP PUT method. The PUT method is mainly used 
                    during development of applications, and allows developers to 
                    upload (or put) files on the server within the web root. By 
                    nature of the design, the PUT method typically does not 
                    provide any filtering and therefor allows sever side 
                    executable code (PHP, ASP, etc) to be uploaded to the 
                    server. Cyber-criminals will search for servers supporting 
                    the PUT method with the intention of modifying existing 
                    pages, or uploading web shells to take control of the 
                    server. Arachni has discovered that the affected path allows 
                    clients to use the PUT method. During this test, Arachni has 
                    PUT a file on the server within the web root, and 
                    successfully performed a GET request to its location and 
                    matched the contents.},

                    globally disabled. This can typically be done with a simple 
                    configuration change on the server. The steps to disable the 
                    PUT method will differ depending on the type of server being 
                    used (IIS, Apache, etc.). For cases where the PUT method is 
                    required to meet application functionality, such as REST 
                    style web services, then strict limitations should be 
                    implemented to ensure that only secure (SSL/TLS enabled), 
                    and authorised clients are permitted to use the PUT method. 
                    Additionally, the servers file system permissions should 
                    also enforce strict limitations.}
