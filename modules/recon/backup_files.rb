                    applications is to create a copy/backup of a particular file 
                    or directory prior to making any modification to the file. 
                    Another common practice it to add an extension or change the 
                    name to the original file representing it as a backup 
                    (examples include .bak, .orig, .backup, etc.). During the 
                    initial recon stages of an attack cyber-criminals will 
                    attempt to locate backup files by adding common extensions 
                    onto files already discovered on the webserver. By analysing 
                    the response headers from the server they are able to 
                    determine if the backup file exists. These backup files can 
                    then assist in further compromise of the web application. By 
                    utilising the same method, Arachni was able to discover a 
                    possible backup file. },

                    virtual root, edit them there, and move (or copy) the files
