                description: %q{The X-Forwarded-For header is utilised by 
                    proxies and/or load balancers to track the originating IP 
                    address of the client. As the request progresses through a 
                    proxy, the X-Forwarded-For header is added to the existing 
                    headers, and the value of the clients IP is the set within 
                    this header. Occasionally, poorly implemented access 
                    restrictions are based off of the originating IP address 
                    alone. For example any public IP address may be forced to 
                    authenticate, while an internal IP address does not. Because 
                    this header can also be set by the client it allows cyber-
                    criminals to spoof their IP address and potentially gain 
                    access to restricted pages. Arachni discovered a resource 
                    that it did not have permission to access, Arachni has 
                    attempted to spoof the address of the localhost (127.0.0.1) 
                    and been granted access. Therefor bypassing any requirement 
                    to authenticate.},

                    depending on the framework being used, and how the 
                    application has been coded. However, the X-Forwarded-For 
                    header should never be used to validate a client's access 
                    as it is trivial to change. A cheat sheet on session
