                    multiple files and directories, however it is possible that 
                    over time some files may become unreferenced (used) by the 
                    web application and forgotten about by the 
                    administrator/developer. Because web applications are built 
                    using common frameworks, they contain common files that can 
                    be discovered (independent of server). During initial recon 
                    stages of an attack cyber-criminals will attempt to locate 
                    unreferenced files in the hope that the file will assist in 
                    further compromise of the web application. To achieve this 
                    they will make thousands of requests using word lists 
                    containing common filenames. The response headers from the 
                    server will then indicate if the file exists. Arachni also 
                    contains a list of common file names which it will attempt 
                    to access. Based off the server response the affected file 
                    was discovered.},

                    be removed from the web root, and/or the application

                    be an option and stop a client being able to view the 
                    contents of a file however it is still likely that the 
                    filenames will be able to be discovered. Using obscure 
                    filenames is only implementing security through obscurity 
                    and is not a recommended option.}
