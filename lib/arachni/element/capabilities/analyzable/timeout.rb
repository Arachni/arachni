# Evaluates whether or not the injection of specific data affects the response
# time of the web application.
#
# It takes into account unstable network conditions and server-side failures and
# verifies the results before logging.
#
# # Methodology
#
# Here's how it works:
#
# * Phase 1 ({#timeout_analysis}) -- We're picking the low hanging
#   fruit here so we can run this in larger concurrent bursts which cause *lots*
#   of noise.
#   - Initial {#timing_attack_probe probing} for candidates, if element submission
#       times-out it is added to the Phase 2 queue.
# * Phase 2 ({.analysis_phase_2}) -- {#timing_attack_verify Verifies} the
#   candidates. This is much more delicate so the concurrent requests are lowered
#   to pairs.
#   - Control check -- Ensures that the webapp is alive and not just timing-out
#       by default.
#   - {#timing_attack_verify Verification} using an increased timeout delay --
#       Any elements that time out again are logged.
#   - Stabilization ({#ensure_responsiveness}).
# * Phase 3 ({.analysis_phase_3}) -- Same as phase 2 but with a higher
#   delay to ensure that false-positives are truly weeded out.
#
# Ideally, all requests involved with timing attacks would be run in sync mode
# but the performance penalties are too high, thus we compromise and make the
# best of it by running as little an amount of blocking requests as possible
# for any given phase.
#
# # Usage
#
# * Call {#timeout_analysis} to schedule requests for Phase 1.
# * Call {Arachni::HTTP::Client#run} to run the Phase 1 requests which will populate
#   the Phase 2 queue with candidates -- if there are any.
# * Call {.run} to filter the candidates through Phases 2 and 3 to ensure that
#   false-positives are weeded out.
#
# Be sure to call {.run} as soon as possible after Phase 1, as the candidate
# elements keep a reference to their auditor which will prevent it from being
# garbage collected.
#
# This deviates from the normal framework structure because it is preferable
# to run timeout audits separately in order to avoid interference by other
# audit operations.
