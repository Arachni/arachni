    # common which makes it possible to spot them without much bother.

    # there's a bug or an unforeseen edge-case or something.

    # Also, identified resources should be analyzed by the {Trainer} but there
    # can be cases where unreliable custom-404 signatures lead to FPs and feeding
    # FPs to the system can create an infinite loop.
