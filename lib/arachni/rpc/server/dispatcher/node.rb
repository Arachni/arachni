# Dispatcher node class, helps maintain a list of all available Dispatchers in
# the grid and announce itself to neighbouring Dispatchers.
#
# As soon as a new Node is fired up it checks-in with its neighbour and grabs
# a list of all available peers.
#
# As soon as it receives the peer list it then announces itself to them.
#
# Upon convergence there will be a grid of Dispatchers each one with its own
# copy of all available Dispatcher URLs.
