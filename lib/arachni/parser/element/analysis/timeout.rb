#
# Evaluates whether or not the injection of specific data affects the response
# time of the web application.
#
# It takes into account unstable network conditions and server-side failures and
# verifies the results before logging.
#
# == Methodology
#
# Here's how it works:
# * Loop 1 ({#timeout_analysis}) -- Populates the candidate queue. We're picking the low hanging
#   fruit here so we can run this in larger concurrent bursts which cause *lots* of noise.
#   - Initial probing for candidates -- If element times out it is added to a queue.
#   - Stabilization ({#responsive?}) -- The element is submitted with its default values in
#     order to wait until the effects of the timing attack have worn off.
# * Loop 2 ({timeout_analysis_phase_2}) -- Verifies the candidates. This is much more delicate so the
#   concurrent requests are lowered to pairs.
#   - Liveness test -- Ensures that the webapp is alive and not just timing-out by default
#   - Verification using an increased timeout delay -- Any elements that time out again are logged.
#   - Stabilization ({#responsive?})
#
# Ideally, all requests involved with timing attacks would be run in sync mode
# but the performance penalties are too high, thus we compromise and make the best of it
# by running as little an amount of concurrent requests as possible for any given phase.
#
# == Usage
#
# Call {#timeout_analysis} to schedule a timeout audit and execute {timeout_audit_run}
# to run the scheduled operations.
#
# This deviates from the normal framework structure because it is preferable
# to run timeout audits separately in order to avoid interference by other
# audit operations.
#
# If you want to be notified every time a timeout audit is performed you can pass
# callback block to {on_timing_attacks}.
