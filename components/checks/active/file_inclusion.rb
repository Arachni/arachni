Web applications occasionally use parameter values to store the location of a file
which will later be required by the server.

An example of this is often seen in error pages, where the actual file path for
the error page is stored in a parameter value -- for example `example.com/error.php?page=404.php`.

A file inclusion occurs when the parameter value (ie. path to file) can be
substituted with the path of another resource on the same server, effectively
allowing the displaying of arbitrary, and possibly restricted/sensitive, files.

Arachni discovered that it was possible to substitute a parameter value with another
resource and have the server return the contents of the resource to the client within
the response.

It is recommended that untrusted data is never used to form a file location to
be included.

To validate data, the application should ensure that the supplied value for a file
is permitted. This can be achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter
value, by matching it against a list of permitted files. If the supplied value
does not match any value in the whitelist, then the server should redirect to a
standard error page.

In some scenarios, where dynamic content is being requested, it may not be possible
to perform validation against a list of trusted resources, therefore the list must
also become dynamic (updated as the files change), or perform filtering to remove
extraneous user input (such as semicolons, periods etc.) and only permit `a-z0-9`.

It is also advised that sensitive files are not stored within the web root and
that the user permissions enforced by the directory are correct.
