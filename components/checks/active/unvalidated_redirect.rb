Web applications occasionally use parameter values to store the address of the
page to which the client will be redirected -- for example:
`yoursite.com/page.asp?redirect=www.yoursite.com/404.asp`

An unvalidated redirect occurs when the client is able to modify the affected
parameter value in the request and thus control the location of the redirection.
For example, the following URL `yoursite.com/page.asp?redirect=www.anothersite.com`
will redirect to `www.anothersite.com`.

Cyber-criminals will abuse these vulnerabilities in social engineering attacks
to get users to unknowingly visit malicious web sites.

Arachni has discovered that the server does not validate the parameter value prior
to redirecting the client to the injected value.

The application should ensure that the supplied value for a redirect is permitted.
This can be achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter value.

The whitelist should contain a list of pages or sites that the application is
permitted to redirect users to. If the supplied value does not match any value
in the whitelist then the server should redirect to a standard error page.
