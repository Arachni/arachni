A modern web application will be reliant on several different programming languages.

These languages can be broken up in two flavours. These are client-side languages
(such as those that run in the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side
languages (which are executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form
the dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.

Because all server side code should be executed by the server, it should never be
seen by the client. However in some scenarios, it is possible that:

1. The server side code has syntax errors and therefore is not executed by the
    server but is instead sent to the client.
2. Using crafted requests it is possible to force the server into displaying the
    source code of the application without executing it.

As the server-side source code often contains sensitive information, such as
database connection strings or details into the application workflow, this can be
extremely risky.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to discover pages that either accidentally or
forcefully allow the server-side source code to be disclosed, to assist in
discovering further vulnerabilities or sensitive information.

Arachni has detected server-side source code within the server's response.

(.JPG or .PNG) and may require manual verification.)_

It is important that input sanitisation be conducted to prevent application files
(ASP, JSP, PHP or config files) from being called. It is also important that the
file system permissions are correctly configured and that all unused files are
removed from the web root.

If these are not an option, then the vulnerable file should be removed from the server.
