# Cross-Site Request Forgery check.
#
# It uses 4-pass reverse-diff analysis to determine which forms affect business logic
# and audits them for CSRF.
#
# Using this technique noise/false-positives should be kept to a minimum,
# however we do need to jump through some hoops.
#
# The technique used to identify which forms are CSRF worthy is described bellow.
#
# === 4-pass rDiff CSRF detection:
#
# * Request each page *without* cookies
#   * Extract forms.
# * Request each page *with* cookies
#   * Extract forms.
# * Check forms that appear *only* when logged-in for CSRF.
#
# In order for the check to give meaningful results, a valid session of a
# logged-in user must be supplied to the framework.
#
# However, as Arachni goes through the system it will gather
# cookies just like a user would, so if there are forms that only appear
# after a guest has performed a previous event it will check these too.

In the majority of today's web applications, clients are required to submit forms
which can perform sensitive operations.

An example of such a form being used would be when an administrator wishes to
create a new user for the application.

In the simplest version of the form, the administrator would fill-in:

* Name
* Password
* Role (level of access)

Continuing with this example, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) would occur when
the administrator is tricked into clicking on a link, which if logged into the
application, would automatically submit the form without any further interaction.

Cyber-criminals will look for sites where sensitive functions are performed in
this manner and then craft malicious requests that will be used against clients
via a social engineering attack.

There are 3 things that are required for a CSRF attack to occur:

1. The form must perform some sort of sensitive action.
2. The victim (the administrator in the example above) must have an active session.
3. Most importantly, all parameter values must be **known** or **guessable**.

Arachni discovered that all parameters within the form were known or predictable
and therefore the form could be vulnerable to CSRF.

_Manual verification may be required to check whether the submission will then
perform a sensitive action, such as reset a password, modify user profiles, post
content on a forum, etc._

                remedy_guidance: %q{
Based on the risk (determined by manual verification) of whether the form submission
performs a sensitive action, the addition of anti-CSRF tokens may be required.

These tokens can be configured in such a way that each session generates a new
anti-CSRF token or such that each individual request requires a new token.

It is important that the server track and maintain the status of each token (in
order to reject requests accompanied by invalid ones) and therefore prevent
cyber-criminals from knowing, guessing or reusing them.
