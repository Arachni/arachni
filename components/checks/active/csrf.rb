# Cross-Site Request Forgery check.
#
# It uses 4-pass reverse-diff analysis to determine which forms affect business logic
# and audits them for CSRF.
#
# Using this technique noise/false-positives should be kept to a minimum,
# however we do need to jump through some hoops.
#
# The technique used to identify which forms are CSRF worthy is described bellow.
#
# === 4-pass rDiff CSRF detection:
#
# * Request each page *without* cookies
#   * Extract forms.
# * Request each page *with* cookies
#   * Extract forms.
# * Check forms that appear *only* when logged-in for CSRF.
#
# In order for the check to give meaningful results, a valid cookie-jar of a logged-in
# user must be supplied to the framework.
#
# However, as Arachni goes through the system it will gather
# cookies just like a user would, so if there are forms that only appear
# after a guest has performed a previous event it will check these too.

                description:     %q{
In the majority of today's web applications, clients are required to submit forms
which can perform sensitive operations.

An example of such a form being used would be when an administrator wishes to
create a new user for the application.

In the simplest version of the form, the administrator would fill-in:

* Name
* Password
* Role (level of access)

Continuing with this example, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) would occur when
the administrator is tricked into clicking on a link, which if logged into the
application, would automatically submit the form without any further interaction.

Cyber-criminals will look for sites where sensitive functions are performed in
this manner and then craft malicious requests that will be used against clients
via a social engineering attack.

There are 3 things that are required for a CSRF attack to occur:

1. The form must perform some sort of sensitive action.
2. The victim (the administrator the example above) must have an active session.
3. Most importantly, all parameter values must be **known** or **guessable**.

Arachni discovered that all parameters within the form were known or predictable
and therefore the form could be vulnerable to CSRF.

_Manual verification may be required to check whether the submission will then
perform a sensitive action, such as reset a password, modify user profiles, post
content on a forum, etc._

                remedy_guidance: %q{
Based on the risk (determined by manual verification) of whether the form submission
performs a sensitive action, the addition of anti-CSRF tokens may be required.

These tokens can be configured in such a way that each session generates a new
anti-CSRF token or such that each individual request requires a new token.

It is important that the server track and maintain the status of each token (in
order to reject requests accompanied by invalid ones) and therefore prevent
cyber-criminals from knowing, guessing or reusing them.
