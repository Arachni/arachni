An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that
parses XML input.

This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is
processed by a weakly configured XML parser.

This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service,
port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located,
and other system impacts.

Since the whole XML document is communicated from an untrusted client, it's not
usually possible to selectively validate or escape tainted data within the system
identifier in the DTD.

Therefore, the XML processor should be configured to use a local static DTD and
disallow any declared DTD included in the XML document.
