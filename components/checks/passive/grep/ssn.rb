The US Social Security Number (SSN) is a personally identifiable number that is
issued to its citizens.

A stolen or leaked SSN can lead to a compromise, and/or the theft of the affected
individual's identity.

Through the use of regular expressions, Arachni has discovered an SSN located
within the response of the affected page.

Initially, the SSN within the response should be checked to ensure its validity,
as it is possible that the regular expression has matched a similar number with
no relation to a real SSN.

If the response does contain a valid SSN, then all efforts should be taken to
remove or further protect this information. This can be achieved by removing the
SSN altogether or by masking the number so that only the last few digits are
present within the response (eg. _**********123_).
