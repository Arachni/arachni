Private, or non-routable, IP addresses are generally used within a home or
company network and are typically unknown to anyone outside of that network.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to identify the private IP address range being used
by their victim, to aid in collecting further information that could then lead
to a possible compromise.

Arachni discovered that the affected page returned a RFC 1918 compliant private
IP address and therefore could be revealing sensitive information.

_This finding typically requires manual verification to ensure the context is
correct, as any private IP address within the HTML body will trigger it.

Identifying the context in which the affected page displays a Private IP
address is necessary.

If the page is publicly accessible and displays the Private IP of the affected
server (or supporting infrastructure), then measures should be put in place to
ensure that the IP address is removed from any response.
