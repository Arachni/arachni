The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that is
transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed.

To keep data private, and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often
tunnelled through either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security
(TLS).
When either of these encryption standards are used it is referred to as HTTPS.

Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise credentials passed from the
client to the server using HTTP.
This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or
through network packet captures.

Arachni discovered that the affected page contains a `password` input, however,
the value of the field is not sent to the server utilising HTTPS. Therefore it
is possible that any submitted credential may become compromised.

The affected site should be secured utilising the latest and most secure encryption
protocols.
These include SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.2. While TLS 1.2 is the latest
and the most preferred protocol, not all browsers will support this encryption
method. Therefore, the more common SSL is included. Older protocols such as SSL
version 2, and weak ciphers (< 128 bit) should also be disabled.
