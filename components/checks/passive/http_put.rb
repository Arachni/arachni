There are various methods in which a file (or files) may be uploaded to a
webserver. One method that can be used is the HTTP `PUT` method. The `PUT`
method is mainly used during development of applications and allows developers to
upload (or put) files on the server within the web root.

By nature of the design, the `PUT` method typically does not provide any filtering
and therefore allows sever side executable code (PHP, ASP, etc) to be uploaded to
the server.

Cyber-criminals will search for servers supporting the `PUT` method with the
intention of modifying existing pages, or uploading web shells to take control
of the server.

Arachni has discovered that the affected path allows clients to use the `PUT`
method. During this test, Arachni has `PUT` a file on the server within the web
root and successfully performed a `GET` request to its location and verified the
contents.

Where possible the HTTP `PUT` method should be globally disabled.
This can typically be done with a simple configuration change on the server.
The steps to disable the `PUT` method will differ depending on the type of server
being used (IIS, Apache, etc.).

For cases where the `PUT` method is required to meet application functionality,
such as REST style web services, strict limitations should be implemented to
ensure that only secure (SSL/TLS enabled) and authorised clients are permitted
to use the `PUT` method.

Additionally, the server's file system permissions should also enforce strict limitations.
