A common practice when administering web applications is to create a copy/backup
of a particular directory prior to making any modification.
Another common practice is to add an extension or change the name of the original
directory to signify that it is a backup (examples include `.bak`, `.orig`, `.backup`,
etc.).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate backup directories by adding common extensions onto directories already
discovered on the webserver. By analysing the response headers from the server
they are able to determine if a backup directory exists.
These backup directories can then assist in the compromise of the web application.

By utilising the same method, Arachni was able to discover a possible backup directory.

Do not keep obsolete versions of directories under the virtual web server root.

When updating the site, delete or move the directories to a directory outside the
virtual root, edit them there, and move (or copy) the directories back to the virtual
root.
Make sure that only the directories that are actually in use reside under the virtual root.

Preventing access without authentication may also be an option and stop a client
being able to view the contents of a directory6, however it is still likely that the
filenames will be able to be discovered.

Using obscure filenames is only implementing security through obscurity and is
not a recommended option.
