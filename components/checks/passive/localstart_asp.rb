To restrict access to specific pages on a webserver, developers can implement
various methods of authentication, therefore only allowing access to clients
with valid credentials.
There are several forms of authentication that can be used. The simplest forms of
authentication are known as 'Basic' and 'Basic Realm'.
These methods of authentication have several known weaknesses such as being
susceptible to brute force attacks.

Additionally, when utilising the NTLM mechanism in a windows environment, several
disclosures of information exist, and any brute force attack occurs against the
server's local users, or domain users if the web server is a domain member.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to locate protected pages to gain access to them
and also perform brute force attacks to discover valid credentials.

Arachni discovered the following page requires NTLM based basic authentication
in order to be accessed.

                remedy_guidance: %q{
If the pages being protected are not required for the functionality of the web
application they should be removed, otherwise, it is recommended that basic
and basic realm authentication are not used to protect against pages requiring
authentication.

If NTLM based basic authentication must be used, then default server and domain
accounts such as `administrator` and `root` should be disabled, as these will
undoubtedly be the first accounts to be targeted in any such attack.

Additionally, the webserver should not be joined to any corporate domain where
usernames are readily available (such as from email addresses). If the pages are
required, and it is possible to remove the basic authentication, then a stronger
and more resilient form-based authentication mechanism should be implemented to
protect the affected pages.
