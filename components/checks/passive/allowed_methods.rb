There are a number of HTTP methods that can be used on a webserver (`OPTIONS`,
`HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc.).  Each of these methods perform a
different function and each have an associated level of risk when their use is
permitted on the webserver.

A client can use the `OPTIONS` method within a request to query a server to
determine which methods are allowed.

Cyber-criminals will almost always perform this simple test as it will give a
very quick indication of any high-risk methods being permitted by the server.

Arachni discovered that several methods are supported by the server.

It is recommended that a whitelisting approach be taken to explicitly permit the
HTTP methods required by the application and block all others.

Typically the only HTTP methods required for most applications are `GET` and
`POST`. All other methods perform actions that are rarely required or perform
actions that are inherently risky.

These risky methods (such as `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc) should be protected by strict
limitations, such as ensuring that the channel is secure (SSL/TLS enabled) and
only authorised and trusted clients are permitted to use them.
