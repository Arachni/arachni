                description:    %q{
The browser security model normally prevents web content from one domain from
accessing data from another domain. This is commonly known as the "same origin policy".

URL policy files grant cross-domain permissions for reading data. They permit
operations that are not permitted by default. The URL policy file for Silverlight
is located, by default, in the root directory of the target server, with the name
`crossdomain.xml` (for example, at `www.example.com/crossdomain.xml`).

When a domain is specified in `crossdomain.xml`, the site declares that it
is willing to allow the operators of any servers in that domain to obtain any
document on the server where the policy file resides.

The `crossdomain.xml` file deployed on this website opens the server to all
domains (use of a single asterisk "*" as a pure wildcard is supported).
