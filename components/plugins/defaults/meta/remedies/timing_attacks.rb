Analyzes the scan results and logs issues that used timing attacks while the
affected web pages demonstrated an unusually high response time; a situation
which renders the logged issues inconclusive or (possibly) false positives.

Pages with high response times usually include heavy-duty processing which makes
them prime targets for Denial-of-Service attacks.
